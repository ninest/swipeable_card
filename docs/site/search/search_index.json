This beahviour is commonly seen in card games or dating apps. // CardExample is a custom container with a nice border and rounded corners final List<CardExample> cards = [ CardExample(color: Colors.red, text: \"First card\"), CardExample(color: Colors.blue, text: \"Second card\"), CardExample(color: Colors.orange), CardExample(color: Colors.indigo), CardExample(color: Colors.green, text: \"The next card is the last\"), CardExample(color: Colors.purple, text: \"This is the last card\"), ]; The user should first see the card \"First card\", which is red, so the currentCardIndex is initialized to 0 . In the Scaffold , we see an Align widget with the following children: if (currentCardIndex < cards.length) SwipeableWidget( cardController: _cardController, animationDuration: 500, horizontalThreshold: 0.85, // (1) child: cards[currentCardIndex], nextCards: <Widget>[ // show next card // if there are no next cards, show nothing if (!(currentCardIndex + 1 >= cards.length)) // (2) Align( alignment: Alignment.center, child: cards[currentCardIndex + 1], ), ], onLeftSwipe: () => swipeLeft(), onRightSwipe: () => swipeRight(), ) else // if the deck is complete, add a button to reset deck Center( child: FlatButton( child: Text(\"Reset deck\"), onPressed: () => setState(() => currentCardIndex = 0), ), ), What's going on here? See the comments in the code for the labels (1) and (2) . This is the card on top which the user sees. It is a SwipeableWidget , so users can interact with it and swipe it away. It's child is the cards[currentCardIndex] , so it is the 1st card initially. This is the card behind the current card. The user cannot interact with it. It is cards[currentCardIndex + 1] , so it's the 2nd card initially. You may put as many widgets as you want in nextCards . They will be stacked over each other. As the value of currentCardIndex , increases, the card the user sees (1) and card behind that (2) are both increased appropriately. So when the front card (1) is swiped, currentCardIndex++ is called. This gives an appearance that the card has moved away. What's actually happened is that the SwipeableWidget is putting itself back (with the next card) in the center right after it's animated out. What seems to be happening? This is what the users see: The card is discarded (gone) Next card comes into focus What actually happens? This is what's going on under the hood. The card is animated out of the screen After a delay, the card is moved back to the center without any animaton. Using state management ( setState in this case) to show the next card. In short , the card in the nextCards list. Try removing it to see what happens! Note: It is your job to handle showing the user the next card. In this simple example, to show the next card, all that needs to be done is add 1 to currentCardIndex . This is done by the onLeftSwipe and onRightSwipe functions: void swipeLeft() { print(\"card swiped to the left\"); // going to next card setState(() { currentCardIndex++; }); } void swipeRight() { print(\"card swiped to the left\"); // going to next card setState(() { currentCardIndex++; }); } What about the if statements? They're just there to prevent the app from erroring when the user has reached the end of the deck. When the user is on the last purple card, they won't see a card behind it. And once this last card is swiped, a button will be shown which resets the deck on press. By resetting the deck, it just sets currentCardIndex to 0 . If you're making a game, you may want to get a new list of cards or randomize the the order of the cards first. Using the SwipeableWidgetController This allows you to swipe the cards without having the user touch or pan them. Pass the SwipeableWidgetController like so: SwipeableWidgetController _cardController = SwipeableWidgetController(); ... SwipeableWidget( cardController: _cardController, ... ) Now you can call the following functions: - _cardController.triggerSwipeLeft() - _cardController.triggerSwipeRight() Check out the cardControllerRow widget: Widget cardController(SwipeableWidgetController cardController) { return Row( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround, children: <Widget>[ FlatButton( child: Text(\"Left\"), onPressed: () => cardController.triggerSwipeLeft(), ), FlatButton( child: Text(\"Right\"), onPressed: () => cardController.triggerSwipeRight(), ), ], ); } Tapping on the buttons swipes the cards to the left and right respectively. Improvements you can make 1. Make cards look more natural To do this, you can use the Tranform widgets to rotate the cards by a randomly generated angle, or even change the offset. 2. Disable users from swiping cards If you do need to disable a card, wrap SwipeableWidget with IgnorePointer .
